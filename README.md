## About the Repo
Hi, I'm Mara, a Software Engineer and Content Creator! I've worked in web development at companies like Microsoft and Intel and now juggle programming with creating modest fashion content. I've noticed that a big barrier is not having your own branding and not knowing where to start. I wanted to combine my two passions and I created this open-source link page that allows for content creators to showcase their platforms and whatever links they may need to provide.

The software tools used here have free trials for small-time use. If you surpass the free trials for these tools, it may be time to invest in some custom code for your brand!
